# Sweater Weather Front-End

# Description
This is the front-end repository for the sweater weather project. The back-end repository can be found here: https://github.com/dmeskis/sweater_weather
Sweater Weather is a project bridging between Mod 3 and Mod 4 at Turing School of Software and Design. I built out an API on the back-end in Mod 3 over one week that utilizes several other APIs to fetch weather data, and built the front-end out over the first week of Mod 4.

# How to Use
Check out the app at: https://dmeskis.github.io/sweater_weather_FE/
Note: It may take a while for the back-end server to spin up as it is hosted on Heroku, please give it a few seconds to spin up to display the weather.
